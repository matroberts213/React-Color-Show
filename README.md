# React-Color-Show
I made this app to experiment a little with ReactJS and also with git. This is not a static web app (you must run it on a server to view)

Clone this repository,
Run the command "npm start" in directory.

This will open the app in localhost.

This project currently doesnt have its contact page functioning.
